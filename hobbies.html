<h3> Violin <br /> </h3> 
<p> I've been playing since I was around 10 years old. Learned at a music school but I dropped it when I was in college. Noways I play everyonce in a while.</p>

<h3> Eletric Guitar</h3>
<p> I love heavy metal, and even thought the violin its "kind of" versatile I will never sound heavy as a distorted electric guitar. </p>
